## Data Wrangling, Exploration, Visualization

### Filina Nurcahya-Tjoa UTEID : fnt226 

#### Introduction 

Paragraph or two introducing your datasets and variables, why they are interesting to you, etc.



```{R}
# Importing the First Dataset and Indexing Desired Variables. 
MinimumWageDataSet <- read.csv("Minimum Wage Data (1).csv")
MinimumWageDataSet <- MinimumWageDataSet[,c(1,2,7)]

# Importing the First Dataset and Indexing Desired Variables. 
COVID19Dataset <- read.csv("COVID19_state.csv")
COVID19Dataset <- COVID19Dataset[,c(1:5)]

# Indexing Out the Desired Rows with the Desired Year. 
MinimumWageDataSet <- MinimumWageDataSet[MinimumWageDataSet$Year == 2020,]
```

#### Tidying: Reshaping

If your datasets are tidy already, demonstrate that you can reshape data with pivot wider/longer here (e.g., untidy and then retidy). Alternatively, it may be easier to wait until the wrangling section so you can reshape your summary statistics. Note here if you are going to do this.

```{R}
library(tidyverse)
```

    
#### Joining/Merging

```{R}
# Unique IDs in Each Dataset.
COVID19Dataset %>% select(State) %>% summarise_all(n_distinct)
MinimumWageDataSet %>% select(State) %>% summarise_all(n_distinct)

# Joining Datasets based on ID. 
combineddataset <- inner_join(COVID19Dataset, MinimumWageDataSet, by = "State")

# Seeing which were dropped from the Dataset.
# Seeing which IDs appeared in one but not the other. 
anti_join(MinimumWageDataSet, COVID19Dataset, by = "State")

anti_join(COVID19Dataset, MinimumWageDataSet, by = "State")

```

####  Wrangling

```{R}
# Use Mutate to Create a New Variable.
combineddataset %>% mutate(deathrate = Deaths/Population)

# Use a Stringr Function with Regex Once. 

# Create Summary Statistics of All Numeric Data. 

# Create Summary Statistics of All Numeric Data after Grouping. 

# Compute a Summary Statistic with a User-Defined Function. 

```

Your discussion of wrangling section here. Feel encouraged to break up into more than once code chunk and discuss each in turn.
